# M0nkrus Scripts

Here is a script for [M0nkrus][2].

## Eye Safer
We all love M0nkrus and are thankful for what he does but Jesus that website design is a war crime itself. This removes the background to make it more eye-friendly.

### Installation
1. Install [Violentmonkey][5] (Others like [Tampermonkey][6] work too but are ***not recommended***)
2. Install the [Script][7]
